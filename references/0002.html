<p>Claire Herrington has been our childminder for two years, since our daughter was six months old.</p>
<p>In that time we have found her to be a responsible, easy-going, motivated, skilled and professional person of integrity. She's also a patient and loving carer with who our daughter has developed a strong bond.</p>
<p>She provides high quality care and a dependable routine in her clean and happy home alongside lots of fun and good food. We would have no hesitation in recommending her.</p>
