<p>Claire has been our childminder for 3 years, looking after our eldest, Adam, since he was 5 months old and then our youngest, Toby, since he was 8 months old. We are absolutely devastated that she is moving away to live with her boyfriend, although we are also delighted for her happiness. Claire has been a fantastic part of our lives and has helped me greatly with the more difficult stages of first-time motherhood, including weaning, Adam needing glasses, his needing to wear a patch for a squint and his delayed speech development.</p>
<p>Claire is perfectly suited to her job:  she is sensible, very calm, patient, firm but fair and flexible. She has often agreed to take the children at additional times or swap days to help me out. She makes nutritious and varied meals, and is always open to suggestions. I feel that we have made a lot of decisions about the children together e.g. whether to drop a nap or how to approach potty training.</p>
<p>I can't emphasize enough how wonderful Claire has been and I know she is a gem because I have recently spent 3 weeks interviewing countless childminders and nannies and I can't find anyone who comes close. If I could find a way of getting her from her new home to mine every day, I would still be employing her! I know she is very fond of my two boys and they will miss her greatly.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend her. Please get in touch if you require more information.</p>
