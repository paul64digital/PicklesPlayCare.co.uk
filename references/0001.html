<p>To date, I have known Claire for just over six years. She was my daughter Megan's childminder from the age of 4, providing before and after school care, and was her main carer (from the age of 20 months when she moved out of the baby unit) at Funshine Day Nursery in Shirley. She has also on occasions looked after my daughter Kelly, now nearly 3 years old and regularly babysat them both in the evenings.</p>
<p>During the past six years, I have had daily contact with Claire. I have always found her to be good natured, caring, attentive to the children's needs, helpful and trustworthy. I know Claire to be polite, courteous, respectful and dependable. I have never worried about leaving my children with Claire, always safe in the knowledge that they were in good hands. I have never found fault with her care and will continue to recommend her to my friends. She is a person of integrity and has my complete trust.</p>
