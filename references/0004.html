<p>We have been extremely happy with the care Paige has received, and the great progress she has made whilst in Claire’s care.</p>
<p>Claire’s home is always welcoming and well organised and my daughter has great fun playing with all the toys available and with the other children in Claire’s care. Beyond all this though, it is her warm and friendly but no nonsense approach which sets her apart from other childminders; in our experience.</p>
<p>She provides a fun range of activities. I know Paige has enjoyed drawing, baking cakes and outings to the park.</p>
<p>Claire is a great communicator and has no trouble in gaining Paige’s confidence and therefore encouraging good behaviour and kindness and compassion to others, both skills which are important to us at home. When Paige is hurt or feeling under the weather I know that she feels happy to be comforted by her and I am confident that she can administer either first aid or medication following all the correct procedures and completing the necessary records to ensure her health and safety.</p>
<p>I know that Claire provides healthy meals and snacks due to the “diary” Claire prepares for us parents this helps me to feel involved with her care and that I can talk to her about her day.</p>
<p>I am also aware that Claire ensures good personal hygiene in encouraging all the children to wash their hands before eating and after using the toilet.</p>
<p>All in all I am thoroughly happy with the level of care Paige receives and I’m certain it’s helped her develop into a confident and self assured little girl.</p>
<p>I would absolutely recommend Claire as a great and reliable childminder.</p>
