<p class="subtitle">What to expect from Pickles Playcare</p>

<p>I live in a large house with my partner Steve.  Steve has a current CRB police check and works full time.  He is not registered to care for the children.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Day Time</span><br/>
Your child will spend most of his/her day in the large, bright living room where they have full access to all of the toys and equipment I have to offer.  I encourage all of the children to ask when they want to do a new activity rather than emptying all of the toy boxes out.  Once everybody has agreed on the activity I encourage all of the children to tidy away afterwards.  All of the toys are organised into specific boxes that are clearly labelled with the contents in writing as well as a picture so both the readers and non-readers are able to distinguish what is in them.  I have a structured routine as far as the times the children eat and sleep but when it comes to the times that they take part in activities I encourage as much freedom and choice as possible.  Have a look at our routine.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Visitors</span><br/>
I feel it is important to have other adults and children to play during the day as it encourages children to interact as part of a bigger group and not just the small number of playmates he/she has at my house.  All visitors to the house will be required to fill in a visitors form when they enter the house. </p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Food</span><br/>
All food will be eaten in the kitchen, at the table or in a highchair depending on their age.  All children are asked to wash their hands before and after each meal.  I provide breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner for each child.  Breakfast is usually cereal and/or toast.  Lunch is varied and can be things such as a sandwich and crisps, tomato soup with bread and butter or a bagel and cucumber.  Lunch is always followed by a piece of fruit.  Dinner is always a home cooked, hot meal and wherever possible I try to use healthy fresh food.  Some of the meals I provide are spaghetti bolognese, roast chicken with mash &amp; vegetables, salmon pasta or risotto.  Dinner is always followed by a varied pudding of fromage frais, a piece if fruit or some ice cream.  I also provide a small snack in between meals, this usually consists of fruit or a biscuit.  Juice and/or water is always provided during meal times and is also available during the day.  Each child has their own cup that they have access to at all times.  There is always a copy of the weeks menu on display in the hall so that you can see what is on offer for your child.  You are more than welcome to come to me if you are not happy with something that is on the menu as well as suggest meals you think the children may like to eat and I will try my best to accommodate this.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Nap Time</span><br/>
Nap time is usually in the afternoon, unless your child still requires a morning nap as well. Each child has their own sleep space whether it is in a travel cot or in the bottom bunk bed.  Your child will have their own specific sheet and blanket/quilt to sleep with which I provide and wash weekly.  However if you are more comfortable to provide your own bedding please feel free to do so.  Should your child have any comforters to help them to sleep, please bring them in as well as anything else you think your child might like to have with them while they sleep.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Nappies/Toilet training</span><br/>
I usually change nappies 3 times a day, after breakfast, after lunch and just before dinner as well as anytime they soil their nappy in between change times.  I provide nappy sacks and unscented baby wipes, I also have a small pot of Sudo Crem for occasional use when required.  You are required to provide nappies for your child as well as any other creams/lotions your child uses.  You can either bring in a few nappies every day or bring in a whole packet and I will let you know when you need to bring in more.  When it comes to potty training I will fully co-operate with your method of training at home to make it as easy as possible to achieve one of the most difficult mile stones your child will have to conquer.  Again feel free to provide me with extra clothing every day or bring lots in to keep here.  I will send home all of the clothes your child has soiled.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Milk</span><br/>
Should your child still be too young for cows, soya or goats milk, you will need to provide the formula your baby drinks until he/she is old enough for other types of milk.  You can either leave bottles and formula milk with me and I will sterilise the bottles before each use or you can provide me with ready made bottles on a daily basis.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Allergies</span><br/>
I have experience of providing food for children with a dairy intolerance, so am able to provide the correct food for these children.  However, if your child has a specific food allergy we would need to discuss whether it is possible for me to provide the food or whether it is in your child's best health interests for you to provide food.  I have also catered for children who are vegetarian.  If your child has any other allergy we will need to discuss this on an individual basis.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Religion</span><br/>
If you family follows a religion/faith I will try my best to adhere to those beliefs.  With your help I will encourage all of the children to participate in activities or festivals/celebrations that your child or others take part in.  Also if your child has a specific food requirement due to a religion/faith I will do my best to accommodate that.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Daily books</span><br/>
When your child comes into my care he/she will be provided with a 'daily book'.  In this book I write how long he/she sleeps for, what they ate at mealtimes including snacks and what times they had their nappy changed.  I also write down a brief outline of our day.  You then take the book home daily to read through.  However please feel free to sit and have a brief chat at the end of the day when you come to collect your child.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Photographs</span><br/>
Photographs play a big part in how I like to work.  I believe children feel more welcome if they can see a happy smiling picture of themselves and other people they know.  I have lots of photographs on the walls of the rooms that are used for childminding.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)</span><br/>
As of September 2008 all childminder's are required by law to comply with the Early Years Foundation Stage also known as the EYFS.  The EYFS is a set of learning outcomes based around 6 early learning goals that your child is required to work towards and achieve with my help by the September after their 5th birthday.  I help your child to achieve these goals by providing them with specific 'Focus' activities weekly, based around the 6 early learning goals and writing a small observation on them during the activity.  These observations are then put into your child's individual observation folder which is given to you on a 3 monthly basis to take home and enjoy reading through.  There may also be a photo or a piece of art work to accompany the observation.</p>

<p>I would like to work with you as much as possible when it comes to the care I provide for your child/children as I believe your child will have a much happier day and feel a lot more settled with me if you and I are working together and communicating as a team, so please come to me at any time if you have a query regarding your child or just to have a chat about your child's general well being.</p>
