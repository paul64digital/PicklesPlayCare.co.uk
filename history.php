<p class="subtitle">The History of Pickles Playcare</p>
<p>After leaving school I started working as a 'student' in a private day nursery where I completed NVQ level 2 and 3 in Childcare and Education.  I also received certificates in first aid and food hygiene that are updated as and when required.</p>
<p>After completing my NVQ's I became a qualified Nursery Nurse and continued to work in the nursery for 5 years, thoroughly enjoying my time working there.</p>
<p>I have been childminding for 6 years now and I absolutely love my job as I get to spend quality time with a small group of children each day and I help to nurture them and watch them explore and grow from inquisitive babies to adventurous toddlers and onto being healthy and happy children.</p>
